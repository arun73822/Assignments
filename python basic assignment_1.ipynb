    "     2.Float: It can be repjented as float and it contains decimal point of all numbes examples are -11.45,0.5,4.7 and so          on\n",
    "     3.Complex: It can be reprajented as complex and it contains realpart and imaginary part of it.examples are                    -2+8j,2+9j,-2-3j,4-7j.\n",
    "     4.Boolean: It can be defined as bool class and it has reprajeneted as True(1) and False(0)\n",
    "     5.List: It is collection of integers,float,complex,strings,boolean and it is ordered collection,mutable(i.e we can            change the values inside the list) and list is created by using square brackets i.e []\n",
    "     6.Tuple: Tuple is like as list but only difference is it is immutable and created by using round brackets i.e ()\n",
    "     7.Set: Set is unordered collection of data and repeatative elements are not present in it and it is immutable and            created by usind curley brackets i.e {}\n",
    "     8.String: String is sequence of charecters and created by using sinle or double quotes\n",
